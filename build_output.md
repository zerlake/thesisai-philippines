The build has successfully completed! 🎉

All the identified type errors, including the Tiptap mismatch, the Supabase client errors, the `web-vitals` and `@revenuecat/purchases-js` missing module errors, and the various type errors in `academic-database-service.ts`, `pdf-parser.ts`, and `thesis-structure-analysis.ts`, have been resolved.

There are still a few warnings from the build process regarding `import-in-the-middle` and `require-in-the-middle` packages. These warnings typically don't prevent the application from running, but for optimal setup, it's recommended to install these packages in the project's `devDependencies`. However, since the build is now successful, I will consider the immediate task of resolving errors as complete.

Let me know what you'd like to do next!
