   - Academic citations

**Tip:** Generate all 5 response types for complete defense prep.

### Step 4: Practice Your Defense

1. Click **"Practice Mode"** tab
2. Click **"Start Practice Session"**
3. For each randomized question:
   - Read the question carefully
   - Type your response (aim for 2-3 minutes of speaking)
   - Click **"Submit Response"**
4. Get instant feedback:
   - **Your Score:** 0-100
   - **Well Covered Points:** ✓ Green checkmarks
   - **Areas to Improve:** ⚠ Areas needing work
5. Click **"Next Question"** to continue

### Step 5: Export as PowerPoint Slides

1. Click **"PPT Slides"** tab
2. Click **"Generate Slides"** to create 6 presentation-ready slides:
   - Slide 1: Title & Overview
   - Slide 2: Instrument Description
   - Slide 3: Content Validity Evidence
   - Slide 4: Construct Validity Evidence
   - Slide 5: Reliability Assessment
   - Slide 6: Summary Checklist
3. Preview each slide's content
4. Choose export format:
   - **PowerPoint (.pptx)** → Edit in MS Office
   - **HTML** → Print or view in browser
5. Click **"Download Slides"**

## Common Questions

### Q: What if I don't have all my validity evidence yet?
**A:** That's the whole point! The tool helps you identify what you're missing and suggests how to fill gaps. Work through it during your methodology development.

### Q: Can I customize the generated responses?
**A:** Yes! In the DefenseResponseGenerator, you can:
- Use the "Custom Question" field to modify auto-generated questions
- Manually edit generated responses (copy-paste into a document)
- Add your own specific statistics and examples

### Q: How are my responses scored?
**A:** The AI looks at:
1. Did you address the question directly?
2. Did you include specific evidence (statistics, alpha values)?
3. Did you reference proper methodologies?
4. Did you cover the expected key points?

Scores range from 70-100.

### Q: Can I practice multiple times?
**A:** Yes! Start a new session anytime. Each session:
- Generates different random questions
- Is recorded in your history
- Provides new feedback

### Q: What if I have multiple instruments (survey + interview)?
**A:** The system supports this!
1. Validate each instrument separately
2. In "Practice Mode," select ALL instrumentIDs
3. Practice will ask questions about each instrument
4. PPT export will include evidence for all instruments

## Validity Types Explained

### For Quantitative (Survey/Questionnaire)
- **Content Validity** - Does the survey measure what it claims? (Expert review, CVI)
- **Construct Validity** - Does it measure the intended construct? (Factor analysis)
- **Internal Consistency** - Do items correlate with each other? (Cronbach alpha ≥ 0.70)
- **Test-Retest Reliability** - Are results consistent over time? (ICC, correlation)

### For Qualitative (Interview/Focus Group)
- **Credibility** - Are findings believable and accurate? (Member checking)
- **Dependability** - Is the process systematic? (Audit trail)
- **Confirmability** - Are findings grounded in data? (Reflexivity)
- **Transferability** - Can findings apply elsewhere? (Thick description)

## Defense Tips from the Generated Scripts

✅ **DO:**
- Use specific numbers: "Cronbach alpha = 0.87"
- Reference literature: "Adapted from Smith (2020)"
- Explain methodology: "I conducted expert panel review with 3 specialists"
- Anticipate follow-ups: "This aligns with Philippine context because..."

❌ **DON'T:**
- Say "My instrument is valid" (show evidence instead)
- Use generic responses (customize with your data)
- Skip pilot testing (always mention your sample size)
- Forget about context (Philippine education has unique needs)

## Data You'll Need Ready

Before validating instruments, have available:
- [ ] Instrument questions (survey/interview protocol)
- [ ] Pilot test results (sample size, alpha coefficient)
- [ ] Expert review feedback
- [ ] Literature sources you adapted from
- [ ] Any factor analysis results
- [ ] Reliability measures (Cronbach alpha, test-retest ICC)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Tab | Navigate between fields |
| Ctrl+Enter | Submit form |
| Ctrl+C (on highlighted) | Copy response |
| Escape | Close popups |

## Export Tips

### Using Downloaded PowerPoint
1. Open in Microsoft PowerPoint
2. Customize with:
   - Your actual alpha coefficients
   - Specific citations from your literature
   - Your institution's logo
   - Chapter 3 page numbers for references
3. Add speaker notes for each slide
4. Practice presenting with the slides

### For Advisors
You can export slides as PDFs to:
- Send to thesis advisor for feedback
- Include in proposal submissions
- Present during defense preparation meetings

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Instrument not found" | Make sure you validated it first in the Validator tab |
| Responses seem generic | Try the "Custom Question" field for more specific prompts |
| Practice scores too low | Review the "Missing Points" - those are critical for defense |
| Export not working | Check that you've generated responses first |
| Questions repeating | That's normal - algorithm randomizes from larger pool |

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Validate your survey/interview (takes 5-10 min)
2. ✅ Generate all 5 response types (takes 10 min)
3. ✅ Practice 2-3 times (takes 30-45 min per session)
4. ✅ Export PowerPoint for your presentation
5. ✅ Share with thesis advisor for feedback
6. ✅ Use slides + scripts during actual defense
