## Key Concepts Explained

### Node (Author)
- **Size:** How many papers they published (larger = more papers)
- **Color:** How connected they are (blue = few collaborations, green = many)
- **Position:** Related to who they collaborate with (nearby = collaborators)

### Link (Connection)
- Shows that two authors have co-authored a paper together
- Line thickness can indicate collaboration frequency (current: all same thickness)

### Cluster (Group)
- Multiple authors grouped together = research community/group
- Indicates collaborative research area

### Isolated Node
- Author with few or no collaborations in your search results
- May represent niche research or emerging area

## FAQ Quick Answers

**Q: How many papers do I need?**
A: At least 10-15 papers. More is better for meaningful network.

**Q: Why is my network sparse?**
A: Too few papers or authors don't collaborate much. Try broader search.

**Q: Should I read every author's papers?**
A: No. Start with large green nodes (influential), then expand.

**Q: Is bigger always better?**
A: Not necessarily. Larger nodes = more papers, not better papers. Check abstracts.

**Q: How long does it take to learn?**
A: 5-15 minutes to understand, 20-30 minutes to use effectively.
