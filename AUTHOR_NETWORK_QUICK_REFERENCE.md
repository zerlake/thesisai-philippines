# Author Collaboration Network - Quick Reference

## What Is It?
Visual map showing how researchers collaborate. Each author is a node, co-authorship is a connection.

## Key Visuals
| Visual | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Large node** | Author published many papers in search results |
| **Small node** | Author has 1-2 papers in search results |
| **Green node** | Author collaborates with many others |
| **Blue node** | Author has few collaborators |
| **Line between nodes** | Co-authorship relationship |

## How It Helps You Find Papers

**Problem:** 100 papers by 50 different authors - hard to organize
**Solution:** Author Network shows you:
1. Who the main researchers are (large nodes)
2. Who works together (connected clusters)
3. Which groups focus on similar topics
4. How the research community is structured

## Basic Usage

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Hover over node** | See author name, paper count, connections |
| **Click node** | Select author (notification shows paper count) |
| **Drag canvas** | Pan to explore different areas |
| **Use Zoom buttons** | Get closer or see whole network |
| **Click Play/Pause** | Pause animation to examine static view |

## 3-Step Research Workflow

### Step 1: Search & Analyze
- Search for your topic (10+ papers needed)
- Open "Author Network" tab
- Study the network pattern

### Step 2: Identify Key Researchers
- Look for large green nodes (many papers, many collaborations)
- These are influential researchers in your field

### Step 3: Systematic Collection
- Click each major author
- Add their papers to collection
- You've now systematically covered your field

## Examples

### Scenario A: Clear clusters visible
```
You see 3 separate groups of connected authors
→ Different schools of thought or research groups
→ Read papers from each group for balanced perspective
```

### Scenario B: One dominant hub
```
You see one author (large green node) connected to many others
→ Central figure in the field
→ Start with their papers, then branch out to collaborators
```

### Scenario C: Sparse/disconnected network
```
Few connections between authors, many isolated nodes
→ Topic is new or very niche
→ Expand search with broader terms
→ Each author represents independent research direction
```

## Pro Tips

✅ **DO:**
- Use when you have 15+ papers
- Look for clusters (research communities)
- Start with largest green nodes
- Use with Search Results tab for content
- Zoom in/out to find different patterns

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use with <5 papers (too sparse to be useful)
- Expect to read every author's papers
- Skip smaller blue nodes entirely (they may have important work)
- Ignore isolated nodes (they might represent emerging areas)

## Visual Interpretation Quick Guide

```
LARGE GREEN NODE = "I'm a prolific, well-connected researcher"
LARGE BLUE NODE = "I've published a lot but mostly solo"
SMALL GREEN NODE = "Few papers but active collaborator"
SMALL BLUE NODE = "Few papers, mostly solo work"
ISOLATED NODE = "Independent researcher in niche area"
TIGHT CLUSTER = "Active research team/group"
```

## Navigation Controls

```
⬆️ Top-right corner controls:
├─ 🔍+ = Zoom in
├─ 🔍- = Zoom out  
├─ ↶ = Reset view
└─ ⏸️ = Pause animation
```

## When It's Most Useful

### ✅ Use for:
- Literature reviews (understanding field structure)
- Finding influential authors
- Discovering research groups
- Mapping research communities
- Ensuring comprehensive coverage

### ❌ Skip for:
- Specific author searches ("papers by John Smith")
- Small datasets (<5 papers)
- Highly niche topics
- When you just want to read papers

## Integration with Other Tabs

| Tab | Purpose | Use Together With Network |
|-----|---------|--------------------------|
| **Search Results** | Read paper content | After identifying authors in network |
| **Collections** | Organize papers | To save papers from network exploration |
| **Network Map** | See paper relationships | Different from author network (papers vs. people) |

## Before Using

**Have you:**
- ✅ Performed a search? (should have papers in results)
- ✅ Got 10+ papers? (network needs minimum density)
- ✅ Want to explore author relationships? (not just read papers)

**If yes → Use Author Network!**
**If no → Try Search Results or try different search terms first**

## Success Indicators

You're using it well if you:
- ✅ Identified 3-5 main research groups
- ✅ Found several influential authors
- ✅ Understood different perspectives on topic
- ✅ Can trace connections between papers/authors
- ✅ Feel confident you have comprehensive coverage

## Common Issues & Fixes

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| "No author connections" | No papers or no author data | Search for papers first |
| Very sparse network | Too few papers | Search with broader terms |
| Can't see details | Zoomed too far out | Use Zoom In or Reset View |
| Network too cluttered | Too many authors | Zoom in on specific cluster |
| Can't identify patterns | Animation moving too fast | Click Pause button |

**Remember:** The Author Network is a map of your research field. Large green clusters = main highways. Blue nodes = quiet roads. Isolated nodes = unexplored territories.
