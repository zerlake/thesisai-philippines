# Author Collaboration Network Guide

## What is the Author Collaboration Network?

The **Author Collaboration Network** is an interactive visual map showing the relationships between authors who have co-authored papers in your search results. It's a graph visualization where:

- **Nodes** (circles) represent individual authors
- **Links** (lines) represent co-authorship relationships
- **Node size** indicates how prolific an author is (larger = more papers)
- **Node color** indicates how connected an author is to others (blue = fewer collaborations, green = many collaborations)

## Why is it Important for Finding Research Papers?

### 1. **Discover Research Communities**
When you search for papers on a topic, the collaboration network reveals which authors work together frequently. This shows you the main research communities and research groups active in your field.

**Example:** Searching for "machine learning in education" might show clusters of authors from different universities who frequently collaborate, helping you identify which groups are most active.

### 2. **Find Key Researchers & Thought Leaders**
Authors with larger nodes and more connections (green nodes) are influential researchers with:
- Extensive publication records
- Strong collaboration networks
- High visibility in their research area

**Example:** An author with a large green node has published many papers AND collaborates with many researchers, indicating they're a central figure in the field.

### 3. **Trace Research Lineages**
Following the collaboration paths shows how ideas evolve and spread through a research community. You can see which authors work together and identify research mentorships or long-term collaborations.

**Example:** Following links from an author might reveal they collaborate with a well-known researcher, indicating they work in a recognized research lineage.

### 4. **Expand Your Search Systematically**
Instead of random searches, you can:
- Click an influential author to see all their papers
- Identify their collaborators
- Then explore those collaborators' papers
- Systematically cover the research landscape

**Example:** Starting with one author's 5 papers, you discover they collaborate with 12 other authors who collectively have published 150 papers in your research area.

### 5. **Avoid Redundant Literature**
If multiple co-authors appear together frequently, they're likely writing on the same subtopic. Understanding the network helps you:
- Identify different schools of thought
- Find papers from different research groups
- Ensure comprehensive coverage of different perspectives

## How to Use the Author Collaboration Network

### Step 1: Perform Your Initial Search
1. Use the **Search Bar** at the top to search for papers on your topic
2. Enter keywords relevant to your thesis (e.g., "adaptive learning systems", "game-based assessment")
3. Click **Search Results** tab to see papers

### Step 2: Open the Author Network Tab
In the **Navigation Tabs** section:
1. Click the **Author Network** tab (shows icon with connected users)
2. The network visualization will load and display authors from your search results

### Step 3: Interact with the Network

#### **Navigation Controls** (top-right corner):
- **🔍+ (Zoom In)**: Get closer view of author clusters
- **🔍- (Zoom Out)**: See the entire network at once
- **↶ (Reset)**: Return to default view
- **⏸️ (Play/Pause)**: Pause the physics animation to examine the network statically

#### **Mouse Controls**:
- **Hover over nodes**: See author tooltips showing:
  - Author name
  - Number of papers they've authored
  - Number of collaborators
  - Up to 3 of their paper titles
  
- **Click on nodes**: Select an author (shows notification with paper count)
  
- **Drag canvas**: Pan around to explore different regions
  
- **Drag nodes**: Move nodes around (if you want to rearrange for clarity)

### Step 4: Identify Patterns

#### **Look for clusters:**
- Authors grouped together = active research team
- Isolated nodes = independent/solo researchers
- Hub authors (many connections) = influential researchers

#### **Understand the colors:**
- **Blue nodes**: Authors with few collaborators
- **Green nodes**: Authors with many collaborations (well-connected)
- **Bright green nodes**: Very influential, prolific collaborators

#### **Understand the sizes:**
- **Large nodes**: Authors with many papers in results
- **Small nodes**: Authors with just 1-2 papers in results

### Step 5: Drill Down

Once you identify interesting authors:
1. **Click on an author node** to select them
2. The system will highlight their papers
3. From there, you can:
   - Add papers to your collection
   - Read abstracts
   - Find PDFs
   - See which authors they collaborate with

### Example Workflow for Thesis Research

**Goal:** Find comprehensive literature on "Gamification in Educational Assessment"

**Step 1:** Search for papers
- Search: "gamification educational assessment"
- Get 45 papers

**Step 2:** Open Author Network tab
- See network of 38 authors

**Step 3:** Analyze the network
- Notice cluster of 7 authors all connected (color: bright green)
- These are the main researchers in gamification assessment

**Step 4:** Identify subfields
- Notice separate cluster of 5 authors (color: light blue)
- They focus on different aspects of assessment

**Step 5:** Systematic exploration
- Click the largest node (Dr. A) → see her 8 papers
- Note her collaborators (Dr. B, C, D)
- Click Dr. B → see her 6 papers in your results
- Notice she also collaborates with Dr. E and F

**Step 6:** Expand search
- Now you have key authors: A, B, C, D, E, F
- You understand the research structure
- You can search for papers from each author's group separately
- You build a comprehensive picture of the field

## Advanced Tips

### Find Pioneering Authors
- Authors with older papers in your results but many citations are pioneers
- They usually have moderate-to-high node sizes
- Following their recent collaborators shows current directions

### Identify Research Gaps
- Authors who don't connect to the main cluster are exploring new areas
- These isolated nodes represent untapped research directions
- Their papers might reveal opportunities for your thesis

### Track Field Evolution
- If your search spans multiple years:
  - New authors appearing = emerging researchers
  - Authors disappearing = topic transitions
  - New links = emerging collaborations

### Use with Paper Content
The Author Network works best when combined with:
- **Search Results tab**: Read papers to understand the content
- **Collections tab**: Organize papers by author or research group
- **Network Map tab**: See how papers relate conceptually

## When to Use the Author Network

### ✅ **Use when:**
- You have 10+ papers from your initial search
- You want to systematically explore a research field
- You need to identify key researchers in your topic
- You want to understand research communities
- You're building a comprehensive literature review

### ❌ **Skip when:**
- You have fewer than 5 papers (network is too sparse)
- You already know the key authors in your field
- Your research is highly niche (few authors)
- You need specific paper content (use Search Results instead)

## Common Questions

### Q: Why does my network look sparse/disconnected?
**A:** Your search results have few papers or they're by different author groups. Try:
- Expanding your search (fewer keywords, broader terms)
- Searching for more general topics first
- Using different search terms

### Q: How do I find papers from a specific author?
**A:** 
1. Locate their node in the network
2. Hover to see their papers list
3. Click the node
4. Search directly for their name in the Search Bar

### Q: Why are some authors not connected to others?
**A:** They haven't co-authored papers with each other in your search results. They might collaborate on different topics or in different time periods.

### Q: Should I read papers from all authors in a cluster?
**A:** Not necessarily. Use the node size as a guide:
- Larger nodes = more relevant papers in your search
- Start with large nodes, then expand to smaller ones
- Read abstracts to filter by relevance

## Integration with Your Thesis Research

Use the Author Collaboration Network as part of your systematic literature review:

1. **Scope Phase** → Use Author Network to understand research landscape
2. **Search Phase** → Use Search Results tab for detailed paper content
3. **Selection Phase** → Use Collections to organize by author/theme
4. **Analysis Phase** → Understand how authors and ideas connect

This multi-tab approach ensures you build a well-rounded, comprehensive understanding of your research topic while avoiding gaps or redundancy in your literature review.
