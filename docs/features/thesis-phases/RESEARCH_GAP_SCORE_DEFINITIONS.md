# Research Gap Identifier - Score Definitions Guide

## Overview

The Research Gap Identifier displays three critical scores for each identified research gap. Understanding these scores helps students select the most appropriate gap for their thesis research.

## The Three Scores

### 1️⃣ **Novelty Score** (Blue) 🔷

**Definition**: How original and unique is this research gap compared to existing studies?

**Range**: 0-100

**What It Measures**:
- How new is this research area?
- Has similar research been done recently?
- Does the gap represent unexplored territory?
- Is this a truly novel contribution to the field?

**Scoring Breakdown**:
- **90-100**: Highly original research area with minimal prior exploration
- **70-89**: Original approach to an understudied aspect
- **50-69**: Somewhat new angle on existing research
- **30-49**: Well-explored area with small new angles
- **0-29**: Highly studied topic with limited novelty

**Example**:
- ✅ **High Novelty (95)**: "Long-term impact of digital learning on critical thinking in Philippine context post-2020" 
  - Few studies exist in this specific context and timeframe
- ❌ **Low Novelty (35)**: "General effects of technology on learning"
  - Extensively researched; limited new perspective

**Why It Matters**:
- Higher novelty gaps are more likely to make a significant contribution
- May face fewer competitors researching the same topic
- Could result in more publishable findings

### 2️⃣ **Feasibility Score** (Green) 🟢

**Definition**: How practical and achievable is it to conduct research to address this gap given time, resources, and access?

**Range**: 0-100

**What It Measures**:
- Can you realistically access the study population?
- Do you have sufficient time and resources?
- Are there ethical/legal barriers?
- Is the research methodology achievable for you?
- Can data be collected/analyzed within thesis timeline?

**Scoring Breakdown**:
- **90-100**: Highly achievable with readily available resources and participants
- **70-89**: Achievable with moderate planning and resource allocation
- **50-69**: Feasible but requires significant time/resources investment
- **30-49**: Challenging; requires specialized access or extensive resources
- **0-29**: Extremely difficult or impossible to execute as thesis research

**Example**:
- ✅ **High Feasibility (80)**: "Effects of a specific app on student grades" 
  - Can access students, study runs 1-2 semesters, straightforward data collection
- ❌ **Low Feasibility (25)**: "Long-term longitudinal study of vaccine effects over 10 years"
  - Requires extended timeframe beyond thesis period, limited participant access

**Why It Matters**:
- Helps you choose a gap you can actually complete
- Prevents choosing overly ambitious research
- Increases likelihood of thesis completion
- Balances novelty with practicality

### 3️⃣ **Significance Score** (Purple) 🟣

**Definition**: How important and impactful would addressing this gap be to the field, practitioners, and society?

**Range**: 0-100

**What It Measures**:
- Does addressing this gap solve a real problem?
- Will the findings influence practice or policy?
- Does it benefit a specific population?
- Does it advance theoretical understanding?
- Is there practical application?

**Scoring Breakdown**:
- **90-100**: Critically important; addressing it would significantly improve practice/policy/understanding
- **70-89**: High importance; findings would meaningfully impact the field
- **50-69**: Moderate importance; useful but limited immediate impact
- **30-49**: Low importance; interesting but minimal real-world application
- **0-29**: Minimal impact; primarily academic curiosity

**Example**:
- ✅ **High Significance (95)**: "Mental health intervention effectiveness in resource-limited Philippine communities"
  - Directly addresses public health crisis, informs policy, improves lives
- ❌ **Low Significance (20)**: "Preference for color of textbook covers among students"
  - Interesting but limited practical value

**Why It Matters**:
- Justifies why your research matters
- Helps with thesis defense (shows why panel should care)
- Connects to broader goals (SDGs, societal needs)
- Makes research more publishable

### Ideal Balance

**Best Thesis Gaps** have:
- ✅ Moderate to high Novelty (60+)
- ✅ High Feasibility (70+)
- ✅ High Significance (75+)

### Trade-offs

| Scenario | Novelty | Feasibility | Significance | Best For |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| High in all | 80+ | 80+ | 80+ | Ideal thesis |
| High novelty, low feasibility | 90+ | 40 | 75+ | Future research (not now) |
| High feasibility, low significance | 50 | 95+ | 40 | Practice/skill-building |
| High significance, low feasibility | 70 | 30 | 95+ | Advocacy/policy paper |
| All moderate | 60 | 60 | 60 | Safe, achievable thesis |

### Choosing Your Gap

**Choose based on your situation**:

1. **First Thesis/Limited Resources**
   - Prioritize: Feasibility > Significance > Novelty
   - Want: Achievable, meaningful, reasonably new

2. **Strong Academic Background**
   - Prioritize: Novelty > Significance > Feasibility
   - Want: Original, important, challenging

3. **Community-Based Research**
   - Prioritize: Significance > Feasibility > Novelty
   - Want: Matters to community, doable with partners, contributes new insight

4. **Publishing Goal**
   - Prioritize: Novelty > Significance > Feasibility
   - Want: Original findings, important implications, publishable

## Using Scores in Your Thesis Defense

### When panel asks: "Why this gap?"

Use the three scores to explain:

**"I chose this gap because:**
- **It's novel** (Score: {novelty}/100) - Only {gap count} studies address this in the Philippine context
- **It's feasible** (Score: {feasibility}/100) - I can access {population} and complete within {timeline}
- **It's significant** (Score: {significance}/100) - Addressing this would improve {field/practice/outcomes]"

## Next Steps

1. **Review all identified gaps** - Compare the three scores
2. **Select 1-2 promising gaps** - Balance novelty, feasibility, significance
3. **Validate your choice** - Use the "Validate" tab to check gap clarity
4. **Prepare defense** - Explain why these three scores support your choice
5. **Begin research** - Use recommendations from the gap analysis

## FAQ

**Q: What's a "good" novelty score?**
A: 70+ is good, 80+ is excellent. Depends on field - some areas have more prior work.

**Q: Can I pursue a gap with low feasibility?**
A: Not for your thesis! Save low-feasibility high-significance gaps for future research.

**Q: What if all scores are moderate (50-60)?**
A: That's still valid! Moderate gaps are often the safest thesis choice.

**Q: Which score matters most?**
A: Feasibility is critical (must be achievable). Then balance novelty + significance.

**Q: Can scores change during research?**
A: Yes - as you learn more, scores may shift. Use them as starting guidance, not final judgment.

**Remember**: The best gap for YOUR thesis is one that is:
1. ✅ **Novel enough** to make a contribution
2. ✅ **Feasible enough** to complete
3. ✅ **Significant enough** to matter
