## Choose Your Gaps By Priority

### 🎓 First-Time Thesis Student
```
Priority: FEASIBILITY > SIGNIFICANCE > NOVELTY
Target: 70+ feasible, 60+ significant, 50+ novel
Goal: Complete a solid thesis
```

### 🔬 Strong Academic Background
```
Priority: NOVELTY > SIGNIFICANCE > FEASIBILITY
Target: 80+ novel, 75+ significant, 70+ feasible
Goal: Publish-worthy research
```

### 🤝 Community Research
```
Priority: SIGNIFICANCE > FEASIBILITY > NOVELTY
Target: 85+ significant, 75+ feasible, 60+ novel
Goal: Create real community impact
```

### 📰 Planning Future Researcher
```
Priority: NOVELTY > SIGNIFICANCE > FEASIBILITY
Target: 85+ novel, 80+ significant, 50+ feasible
Goal: Publish now, do full research later
```

## In the Gap List View

**Each gap shows 3 colored boxes with:**

| Color | Score | What to Ask |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 🔷 Blue | Novelty | "Is this a new research area?" |
| 🟢 Green | Feasibility | "Can I actually do this?" |
| 🟣 Purple | Significance | "Does this matter?" |

## Decision Matrix

```
            HIGH NOVELTY    LOW NOVELTY
HIGH FEASIB  ⭐ BEST        ✅ GOOD
             Do this!       Safe choice

LOW FEASIB   🎯 FUTURE      ⚠️ SKIP
             Research       Probably not
             later
```

- **⭐ Top Right**: Best gap - go for it!
- **✅ Bottom Right**: Safe but less original - good backup
- **🎯 Top Left**: Too hard for thesis - save for later
- **⚠️ Bottom Left**: Avoid - not doable and not original

## Score Calculation Hints

Scores are based on:

**Novelty**: 
- How recent is related research?
- How many studies address this exact gap?
- How specific is your gap framing?

**Feasibility**:
- Can you access the population?
- Do you have time? (1-2 years)
- Do you have resources? (budget, equipment, data)
- Are there ethical barriers?

**Significance**:
- Does it solve a real problem?
- Will it influence practice or policy?
- Does it benefit people?
- Is there broader application?

## Sample Gaps Comparison

### Gap A: "Digital Learning Effects on Test Scores"
- **Novelty**: 45 (Very studied)
- **Feasibility**: 90 (Super easy)
- **Significance**: 55 (Limited real impact)
- **Verdict**: Safe but unremarkable ⚠️

### Gap B: "Critical Thinking Development via Socratic Method in Philippine STEM Education"
- **Novelty**: 82 (Fairly original)
- **Feasibility**: 78 (Achievable with effort)
- **Significance**: 88 (Impacts STEM education)
- **Verdict**: Excellent thesis choice ⭐

### Gap C: "Long-term AI Impact on Human Cognition Across Cultures"
- **Novelty**: 95 (Very original)
- **Feasibility**: 30 (Nearly impossible)
- **Significance**: 92 (Critical importance)
- **Verdict**: Save for PhD research 🎯

---

## Before You Choose

Ask yourself:

1. ✅ **Feasibility**: Can I ACTUALLY do this?
2. ✅ **Significance**: Why should ANYONE care?
3. ✅ **Novelty**: Does it add something NEW?

If YES to all 3 → Pick it!

## Recommended Score Ranges by Stage

### For Your Thesis (THIS SEMESTER/YEAR)
```
MINIMUM THRESHOLDS:
- Novelty:      50+  (Must have some new angle)
- Feasibility:  70+  (Must be doable!)
- Significance: 60+  (Must matter somehow)

IDEAL TARGET:
- Novelty:      65-80  (Good balance of original)
- Feasibility:  75+    (Clearly achievable)
- Significance: 75+    (Clearly matters)
```

### For Future Research (After Thesis)
```
CAN PURSUE:
- Novelty:      80+   (Highly original)
- Feasibility:  Any   (Doesn't matter for future)
- Significance: 75+   (Important research)
```

## Pro Tips

1. **Don't obsess over perfect scores** - Balance matters
2. **Feasibility is NON-NEGOTIABLE** - Can't finish = Can't graduate
3. **Significance justifies effort** - Why work on this if it doesn't matter?
4. **Use "Validate" tab next** - Check if your gap statement is clear
5. **Talk to advisor** - They know feasibility constraints
6. **Compare all gaps** - See which scores make the best combination

## When In Doubt

**"Should I pick this gap?"**

| If You Ask | Consider |
|-----------|----------|
| "Is it doable?" | Check **FEASIBILITY** score |
| "Is it new?" | Check **NOVELTY** score |
| "Does it matter?" | Check **SIGNIFICANCE** score |
| "Should I do it?" | All 3 should be 60+ |
| "Is it the best?" | Look for score balance |
