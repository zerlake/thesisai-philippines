## Best Practices from TikTok Research

### Core Principles

1. **Keep Text Minimal**
   - 1-3 bullets per slide, no paragraphs
   - Character limit per bullet: ~80-100 chars
   - Visual bullets only, no full sentences

2. **Maintain Clear Structure**
   - Linear progression: Intro → Problem → Objectives → Method → Results
   - 8-12 slides for 15-minute defense
   - Clear transitions between sections

3. **Time Management**
   - 1.5-2 minutes per slide including Q&A buffer
   - 30-60 second speaking script per slide
   - Visual progress tracking

4. **Design Consistency**
   - Neutral backgrounds (dark theme recommended)
   - Limited color palette
   - Consistent fonts (sans-serif for clarity)
   - No distracting animations

5. **Language Support**
   - Presenter notes support English/Taglish/Filipino
   - Bullet points in formal English

## Content Guidelines by Slide Type

### Problem/Gap Identification
- **Bullets:** What makes this significant? Who cares?
- **Q&A Risk:** "Why is this important?"
- **Tip:** Use data/statistics to justify urgency

### Methodology
- **Bullets:** Design, population, data collection, analysis
- **Q&A Risk:** "Why this approach? Limitations?"
- **Tip:** Prepare answers for alternative methods

### Results/Findings
- **Bullets:** Key data points only (details in notes)
- **Q&A Risk:** "Unexpected results? Contradictions?"
- **Tip:** Know your data cold; explain outliers

### Conclusions
- **Bullets:** Answer your research questions directly
- **Q&A Risk:** "So what? Implications?"
- **Tip:** Connect findings back to original problem

## Troubleshooting

### "Time Budget Exceeded"
- Red warning appears when slides exceed budget
- Solutions:
  1. Remove low-priority slides
  2. Reduce presenter notes (speak faster)
  3. Increase total time budget if possible

### "Slide Text Too Long"
- Yellow warning on bullets > 100 chars
- Solutions:
  1. Break into multiple bullets
  2. Move detail to presenter notes
  3. Use abbreviations/symbols

### "Content Not Matching Chapters"
- Manually edit slide titles and content
- Can add/delete slides as needed
- Q&A generator adapts to edited slides
