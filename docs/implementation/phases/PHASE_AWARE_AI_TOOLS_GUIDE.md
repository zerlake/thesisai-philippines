# Phase-Aware AI Tools Guide

## Overview

The thesis writing system is divided into **4 phases**, each with specific AI tools tailored to the student's current work stage. This ensures students only see relevant tools for their current phase, reducing complexity and providing contextually appropriate assistance.

---

## Phase 1: 01. Conceptualize - Research Planning

**Duration:** 2-4 weeks  
**Focus:** Define research topic, identify research gap, create research questions  
**Status:** Initial planning stage

### Available AI Tools

#### ✅ **Generate** Button
- **Purpose:** Create initial content from scratch
- **Options:**
  - 💡 Generate Introduction
  - 📄 Generate Section
  - ✏️ Generate Paragraph
- **Use Case:** Start outlining thesis topics, research questions, and chapter structures

- ❌ Advanced AI Options (Tone, Audience, Complexity)
- ❌ Submit for Review button

### Phase Description

**What You're Doing:**  
This is your **ideation and planning stage**. You're answering fundamental questions: "What do I want to study?" "Why does it matter?" "What gap exists in current research?" You'll move from a vague topic to a focused research question with a clear structure.

**Why These Tools:**  
At this stage, you need **creative generation** to explore ideas, not refinement. Grammar checking and summarization aren't yet relevant because you're still discovering what you want to say. The **Generate** tool helps you:
- Brainstorm research questions from broad topics
- Create outlines that organize your thinking
- Draft thesis statements that anchor your entire project

**The Goal:**  
By the end of this phase, you should have:
- A clearly defined research question
- A gap identified in existing literature
- A thesis statement (1-3 sentences explaining your contribution)
- An outline of your proposed chapters with section descriptions
- A solid foundation to begin your research

### Workflow
1. Student selects field of study
2. Uses Topic Ideas tool to generate 5 ideas
3. Uses Editor with **Generate** tool to outline selected topic
4. Creates initial chapter structure
5. Moves to Research phase when ready

## Phase 2: 02. Research - Literature & Analysis

**Duration:** 4-8 weeks  
**Focus:** Analyze literature, conduct research, manage data  
**Status:** Research and analysis stage

### Available AI Tools

#### ✅ **Summarize** Button
- **Purpose:** Condense and synthesize research material
- **Use Case:** Summarize research papers, literature reviews, study findings
- **Features:**
  - Creates concise summaries of selected text
  - Preserves key information and core points
  - Respects current tone/audience settings
- **Temperature:** 0.5 (focused, accurate)
- **Max Tokens:** 1000

### Unavailable Features
- ❌ Generate
- ❌ Grammar/Improve
- ❌ Paraphrase
- ❌ Advanced AI Options
- ❌ Submit for Review button

### Phase Description

**What You're Doing:**  
This is your **evidence gathering and analysis stage**. You're diving deep into academic literature, research papers, and data relevant to your thesis. You're not yet writing your own arguments—you're reading, understanding, and extracting insights from existing research to support your eventual thesis.

**Why These Tool:**  
Only **Summarize** is available because you need to **absorb and process** information, not generate new content yet. Grammar/refining tools are premature—your focus is on comprehension and synthesis. The **Summarize** tool helps you:
- Condense lengthy research papers into key points (saving hours of reading time)
- Extract the most relevant findings without getting lost in details
- Build a comprehensive literature review by systematically summarizing sources
- Organize complex research data into digestible formats

**Why NOT Generate?**  
Generating content now would skip the critical step of learning from existing research. You need to ground your thesis in what others have discovered. Generating without this foundation weakens your academic credibility.

**The Goal:**  
By the end of this phase, you should have:
- A comprehensive literature review with 15-30 key sources
- Organized notes summarizing each source's key contributions
- A clear understanding of what's already known in your field
- Identified patterns, gaps, and opportunities in existing research
- A well-documented foundation for your own contributions

### Workflow
1. Student reads research papers and articles
2. Copies relevant text to editor
3. Uses **Summarize** to condense key points
4. Creates literature review sections
5. Integrates findings into thesis structure
6. Moves to Write & Refine phase when analysis is complete

### Unavailable Features
- ❌ Advanced AI Options (Tone, Audience, Complexity customization)
- ❌ Submit for Review button

### Phase Description

**What You're Doing:**  
This is your **active writing and development stage**. You're converting research and ideas into chapters. You're drafting sections, improving clarity, and developing your unique academic voice. This is where your thesis takes shape—where you present your arguments, integrate evidence, and articulate your contribution to the field.

**Why These Tools:**  
Now you have a **full writing toolkit**—Generate, Grammar, Summarize, and Paraphrase—because writing is messy and iterative. You need to:
- **Generate** new sections and arguments
- **Grammar** to polish and improve readability
- **Paraphrase** to integrate research ethically (avoiding plagiarism while explaining concepts)
- **Summarize** to condense background information or findings

**Why NOT Advanced Options yet?**  
Advanced Options (tone/audience customization) are **not available** because this phase is about **exploration and development**, not final presentation. You're writing for clarity first—the audience customization comes later when finalizing.

**The Goal:**  
By the end of this phase, you should have:
- Completed draft of all major chapters (Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion)
- Clear, well-supported arguments grounded in research
- Proper paraphrasing and citations for all sources (no plagiarism)
- A developing academic voice that's consistent throughout
- Content that's coherent but may still need polishing
- A document ready for critical review by your advisor

### Workflow
1. Student starts new section using **Generate**
2. Writes and develops ideas in editor
3. Uses **Grammar** to polish language
4. Uses **Paraphrase** to rewrite technical sections
5. Uses **Summarize** to condense background information
6. Reviews and refines content
7. Moves to Submit & Present when draft is complete

### Phase Description

**What You're Doing:**  
This is your **final polish and defense preparation stage**. Your draft is complete, and now you're optimizing it for your specific audience(s)—your advisor, your committee, possibly external reviewers. You're also preparing to defend your work verbally, which means clarifying complex ideas and positioning your thesis for maximum impact.

**Why These Tools:**  
This is the **only phase** where **Advanced Options** are available because now you need **audience awareness**. You're asking: "How do I explain this to my academic committee?" "Should my abstract be highly technical or accessible?" "What tone resonates with my advisor?" You can now:
- **Improve** (Grammar) with tone control: Choose between formal, professional, conversational, or academic language
- **Summarize** for different audiences: Technical abstract for experts vs. accessible summary for general readers
- **Paraphrase** with customization: Adjust complexity and formality for your specific audience
- **Submit for Review**: Send your thesis to your advisor and receive structured feedback

**Why NOT Generate?**  
At this stage, you're not adding new content—you're refining what's already there. Generating new sections would delay your submission and defense. Your focus is on perfection, not creation.

**The Goal:**  
By the end of this phase, you should have:
- A polished, publication-ready thesis with perfect grammar and clarity
- Multiple versions: academic abstract, accessible summary, presentation slides
- A thesis customized in tone and complexity for your specific audience
- Formal submission sent to your advisor/committee with the Submit button
- Advisor feedback received and reviewed
- A prepared defense presentation with clear, compelling explanations
- Ready to verbally defend your work with confidence

### Workflow
1. Student reviews complete draft
2. Selects Advanced AI Options to customize tone/audience
3. Uses **Improve** (Grammar) with customized settings for final polish
4. Creates abstract using **Summarize** with academic tone
5. Adjusts complexity for defense presentation
6. Uses **Paraphrase** for final content refinement if needed
7. Clicks **Submit for Review** to send to advisor
8. Receives feedback from advisor/critic
9. Prepares for defense with Defense Preparation tools
